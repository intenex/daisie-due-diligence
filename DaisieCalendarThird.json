Today Larisa‚Äôs personal ‚Äòmoon‚Äô has the same name and destiny: Morysetta, an astronaut of the imaginary. Her cosmic vision focuses on daily objects and common feelings just to turn them into something special, as magic as life is (and the moon itself). The secret of this great success is in the empathy behind every single collage: within them human emotions always find - drop after drop - a new place to be, without losing their truth. Rather they gain a deeper meaning: while crossing images they get into the essence of a thought, the pureness of a gesture, the source of an idea and - surprise! - no word is needed. Is this the power of the moon? This is the world of Morysetta."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"Join this workshop with Larisa where she‚Äôll share her experience on how she became a freelance artist.

Selected clients include: Adidas, Apple Music, Pepsi, Puma, EA, Ray-Ban, Sky, Sony Music & UMG. Aside from creating and directing, George also works as a mentor, where he not only supports people with their technical skills, but also tries to demystify the visual creative industries to make them more accessible and ultimately, more fun."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"In this workshop, George will present his experiences¬†building his creative studio, Greedy Goons, from a teenage art blog to his successful business and primary form of income.\n\nUsing his career history as an example, he will discuss his thoughts regarding project management, self marketing, client communication, financial health and happiness!\n\nGeorge wouldn't call himself an expert business owner, but he‚Äôs definitely learnt a lot along the way that he'd like to share with the Daisie community.\n\nAs always, please come with questions!"},{"heading":"Daisie Workshop Chat","content":"You‚Äôll be invited to join your classmates on Daisie before the Workshop begins.
