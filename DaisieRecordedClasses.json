Every now and then, Clara even laughs out loud while she’s asleep, dreaming. These good vibes, happiness, and energy are characteristics you can expect from her work\n\nDuring her childhood, Clara’s father used to paint landscapes, while her grandma and aunt undertook all sorts of DIY projects. Clara tagged along, and her interest only grew. When painting, she is almost like a scientist in a lab, exploring and experimenting as much and as often as she can, always with the goal of having fun in the process.\n\nAs the pandemic hit, she dove deep into painting, experimenting, and sharing her artwork. Her body of work has three main categories: Watercolour, Impasto, and Squeegee, her most recent area of experimentation."

This is a presentation about giving a presentation. \nGeorge has hosted dozens of workshops on Daisie over the years and dozens more before that with different animation schools.\n\nI'm no public speaking expert; I'm not going to give you the magical 10 tips for banishing your social anxiety - presentations can be nerve-wracking!\n\nHowever, I can discuss my experiences, the highs and lows, providing you with some realistic notes that have personally helped me give better presentations and feel more comfortable.The best way I've found to make presenting as painless as possible (and even enjoyable) is to thoroughly prepare your material. So, I will be sharing my thoughts on: formulating your presentation structure, writing an abstract, gathering resources, designing your presentation, rehearsing, managing failure and slowing down to enjoy the experience.Hope to see you there, come through and ask some Qs!"

She majored in Advertising and specialised in Content Creation, working for small, medium, and big companies like Penguin Random House, AstraZeneca, and H&M. In 2020 she was granted the Adobe Creative Residency Community Fund. She slowly distanced herself from the advertising scene to accompany others on their path of creative self-discovery, which she accomplishes through her membership community, creative newsletter, and workshops. Carla is a firm believer in the power of creative introspection, and she is convinced that great things can be achieved when you combine well-done structures with honest sensitivity. She also believes in the power of Passion Projects, which is why you'll always find her working on one (and encouraging others to create their own)."

Then, taking that data as a starting point and your dreams for the future as a compass, we will work together on designing your 2023 into sprints and tasks. You will leave this session with an emotionally savvy roadmap for the upcoming year."

A good system can take you from overwhelming anxious chaos to clear clarity to be your best creative self.\n\nNatalie teaches her system to plan her whole life, which took years of development, failure and tweaking to create the best full proof system for time management, productivity and project planning that perfectly works for her dyslexic creative mind. In this workshop, you’ll develop a simple 3 step system, from workflow, a master to do list and calendar blocking which will be the foundation of your achieving your creative dreams."

Since graduating from Sheridan College’s Animation program in 2016, she has been working at Canadian animation studios in design roles while creating her own independent cartoons on social media.\n\nAs an international student, coming to Canada at a young age to study Animation provided her with challenges. Michy learned how to work around them and develop the self-direction necessary to pursue her own career."

Join this workshop with Michy where she’ll cover her time as a student preparing for the Animation industry; roles she has worked in the first several years of her career; and her personal projects on social media. Michy will speak on her experiences at animation companies and will touch on the different software/skills involved in these roles. She’ll also discuss how and why she started making personal videos in late 2019/early 2020, and how this compares to working at a studio. That’s not all! Michy will also take the time to share some of the pros and cons of working full time while pursuing personal projects, and how she balances the two. This jam packed workshop with Michy will give you all the tools to help you navigate a career in animation!"

This workshop is going to briefly touch on the history of logo design and branding, before exploring some research avenues and ultimately landing on my thoughts and formulas for creating a successful logo and brand identity. No matter if you're completely new to logo design and branding, or you're a pro, come through and ask some Qs."

She takes slices of life and spin them into head-bopping melodies and heartwarming confessionals. A trailblazer in the Philippine indie scene, Reese has brought her music to international shores like Japan, Singapore, and the USA. “A Song About Space” from her debut album “Arigato, Internet!” was chosen by NASA for their historic #LaunchAmerica campaign videos. Most recently, she appeared in a New York Times Square billboard for Spotify's Equal playlist. She opened for Paramore's Tour Four and garnered praise from front woman Hayley Williams. She also opened for Oh Wonder and has shared stages with artists such as The Temper Trap and LANY. Her music has been noticed and shared by Kpop superstar TEN Lee of NCT. With her signature wit and vocal looping prowess, Reese commands the stage and connects with people who appreciate general weirdness injected into pop earworms."

Through her work she aims to explore different perceptions of beauty and fun narratives to embellish reality and extend it in unexpected ways."

Clients include: Adidas, Apple Music, Pepsi, Puma and much more. Aside from creating and directing, George also works as a mentor, where he not only supports people with their technical skills, but also tries to demystify the creative industries to make them more accessible and ultimately, more fun."

Initially, taking on whatever jobs came his way before finally settling as a motion designer; teaching himself 2D & 3D technical skills entirely through Youtube. Working remotely at first with independent production companies through word-of-mouth, he eventually took the plunge and approached some creative studios, which led him to an internship-come-lead-motion-designer (over the space of almost 3 years) at the Electric Theatre Collective, ETC VFX.\n\nNow leading his own studio, Greedy Goons, George divides his time in between creating commercial motion design and directorial projects within the music industry. Selected clients include: Adidas, Apple Music, Pepsi, Puma, EA, Ray-Ban, Sky, Sony Music & UMG. Aside from creating and directing, George also works as a mentor, where he not only supports people with their technical skills, but also tries to demystify the visual creative industries to make them more accessible and ultimately, more fun."

Initially, taking on whatever jobs came his way before finally settling as a motion designer; teaching himself 2D & 3D technical skills entirely through Youtube. Working remotely at first with independent production companies through word-of-mouth, he eventually took the plunge and approached some creative studios, which led him to an internship-come-lead-motion-designer (over the space of almost 3 years) at the Electric Theatre Collective, ETC VFX.\n\nNow leading his own studio, Greedy Goons, George divides his time in between creating commercial motion design and directorial projects within the music industry. Selected clients include: Adidas, Apple Music, Pepsi, Puma, EA, Ray-Ban, Sky, Sony Music & UMG. Aside from creating and directing, George also works as a mentor, where he not only supports people with their technical skills, but also tries to demystify the visual creative industries to make them more accessible and ultimately, more fun."

He’ll also share his experience from his transition to being a freelance Director and Motion Designer. You’ll explore the creative, financial, social, business, geographic and temporal implications of switching to a freelance life. George will also offer some tips for those who are considering the switch, or those who just want a better understanding."

Initially, taking on whatever jobs came his way, he worked as an illustrator, graphic designer, photographic assistant, editor, club promoter, and West Ham FC/Monster Energy human-merch-mannequin, before finally settling as a motion designer; teaching himself 2D & 3D technical skills entirely through Youtube. Working remotely at first with independent production companies through word-of-mouth, he eventually took the plunge and approached some creative studios, which led him to an internship-come-lead-motion-designer (over the space of almost 3 years) at the Electric Theatre Collective, ETC VFX.\n\nNow leading his own studio, Greedy Goons, George divides his time in between creating commercial motion design and directorial projects within the music industry. Selected clients include: Adidas, Apple Music, Pepsi, Puma, EA, Ray-Ban, Sky, Sony Music & UMG.\n\nAside from creating and directing, George also works as a mentor, where he not only supports people with their technical skills, but also tries to demystify the visual creative industries to make them more accessible and ultimately, more fun."

Ola then dropped out of the university of Toronto to become a Graphic artist/ Graphic designer. He focuses mainly on portrait photography and digital Illustration. \n\nHe is currently based in Toronto, Ontario and studying graphic design at Sault College. Ola started doing digital illustrations in 2018 out of fascination as he had not been into anything artsy since he was 5. He loved how free flowing digital art can be. He posted some of his work on TikTok and Instagram and the reception was unbelievable, and over the past year Ola has been able to form a community of over 200k people online!\n\nOla makes digital illustrations based on pictures he’s taken or that of other creators, with the idea of helping the photo tell its story better, or changing it completely with his imagination. There's always a story in a picture, and Ola’s job is to better convey that story!"

Through her work she aims to explore different perceptions of beauty and fun narratives to embellish reality and extend it in unexpected ways."

His Grandpa gave him his old 35mm Film Camera when he was 16. Years later, his parents then made a promise that if he got a 2:1 in Law, they would buy him a Leica. He now has a 2:1 and a Leica M6.\n\nLouis enjoys documenting key issues that he’s truly passionate about. He’s spent the last few years creating series’ that are dedicated to promoting men's mental health and normalising men speaking about their mental health with their friends and family. His ongoing 'Men-Tal Health' series included interviews and familiar faces from Actor Joe Gilgun to Danny Lomas. He's currently shooting a series documenting love and relationships across the UK.\n\nThe 25-year-old has been shooting fashion advertorials and editorials for the last two years, shooting on 35mm and medium format film. Louis finds it thoroughly enjoyable to explain how film works and the process behind film photography with clients."

From an early age She was fascinated by nature and by the creatures that populated it, perhaps it is here that her passion for observing was born. Always interested in the role of womxn in today’s society, She likes to tell true stories of people who are close to her or even of people She has just met. Since the first approach with photography She has tried to spread a message of inclusion, human’s body has always been objectified and aestheticized. We must represent the reality in which we live, where perfection does not exist. I want gender equality. Through her photos She would like everyone to express the right to be ourselves. Her work has been published and exhibited both in Europe and internationally."

Benjamin studied Media Arts in Hamilton, New Zealand (Aotearoa) before moving to Melbourne (Naarm), Australia. He worked at VICE Asia-Pacific as the Head of Art for over a decade, a role which covered pretty much every visual discipline. Now he's out on his own, where he splits his time between working as a freelance creative and creating his own digital art. He's always been interested in the tension, or the grey murky areas between ideas, whether it's the push and pull between Utopia and Dystopia, or sneaking Fast & Furious References into high-concept interiors."

Whole urban environments are being encoded into his own visual language, maps and frameworks that invite the viewer to discover their own subconscious feelings, dreams and experiences from living and interacting in the city and their relation to the collective.\n \n\nPhilippe has been exhibited throughout Europe with his first solo representation by the Peyton Wright gallery in the United States in 2013. Since then, he has been in various American and French galleries and continues to develop his art about psychogeography mapping."

As artists, mindlessly making something creative can help us reach deeper levels of communication, whether that be through music, painting, photography, and more. Join Philippe as defines psychogeography and shares a playful approach on how he paints the collective and interconnected emotions perceived in our environments through creative maps. This workshop with Philippe will show you how to overcome creative blocks and take the time to analyze, appreciate and translate your own emotional statement at one moment related to specific environments. ‘You are here’ is a moment of pleasant introspection that will shape your own creative process into maps through colours and forms."

Along the way we’ll go step by step through making your own first NFT.\n\nThis is a back-to-back 2 part workshop. It’s recommended that you attend both parts to make the most of the workshop. There will also be plenty of time for questions and interactions so come ready!\n\n2nd Workshop on 10 Feb @ 7pm GMT."
