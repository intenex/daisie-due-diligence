Reading it differently you could have a million different perspectives, views and opinions about how it makes you feel. Since then he has used poetry as a way to express himself, as a medicine to a clogged up mind filled with thoughts and frustrations.\n\nTwo years ago, was the first time he performed in front of an audience.

Working remotely at first with independent production companies through word-of-mouth, he eventually took the plunge and approached some creative studios, which led him to an internship-come-lead-motion-designer (over the space of almost 3 years) at the Electric Theatre Collective, ETC VFX.\n\nNow leading his own studio, Greedy Goons, George divides his time in between creating commercial motion design and directorial projects within the music industry. Selected clients include: Adidas, Apple Music, Pepsi, Puma, EA, Ray-Ban, Sky, Sony Music & UMG.\n\nAside from creating and directing, George also works as a mentor, where he not only supports people with their technical skills, but also tries to demystify the visual creative industries to make them more accessible and ultimately, more fun."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"Using the design outcome from his previous session, George will bring it to life with a motion graphics flare within the hour session.

She'll discuss the technical aspects of using acrylic marker pens, gel pens and washi tape. She will also give you an overall view on where to find or how to store the best paper cuts for making art. Along with some detailed info about her favorite art supplies, Naomi will also show you some finished pieces where these materials have been used in a creative and unusual way. \n\nStudents can interact with the artist asking questions or tips to use these products as their best."},{"heading":"Daisie Workshop Chat","content":"You‚Äôll be invited to join your classmates on Daisie before the Workshop begins.

Reading it differently you could have a million different perspectives, views and opinions about how it makes you feel. Since then he has used poetry as a way to express himself, as a medicine to a clogged up mind filled with thoughts and frustrations.\n\nTwo years ago, was the first time he performed in front of an audience. As much as it was a nerve-racking experience, his stage presence captivates audiences, leaving them entranced in his words. Since then, Ali has been invited to multiple events to perform his poetry, that often centres around self-expression, political insights and identity."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"In this workshop, the floor will be opened to participants to share their own work.

Working remotely at first with independent production companies through word-of-mouth, he eventually took the plunge and approached some creative studios, which led him to an internship-come-lead-motion-designer (over the space of almost 3 years) at the Electric Theatre Collective, ETC VFX.\n\nNow leading his own studio, Greedy Goons, George divides his time in between creating commercial motion design and directorial projects within the music industry. Selected clients include: Adidas, Apple Music, Pepsi, Puma, EA, Ray-Ban, Sky, Sony Music & UMG.\n\nAside from creating and directing, George also works as a mentor, where he not only supports people with their technical skills, but also tries to demystify the visual creative industries to make them more accessible and ultimately, more fun."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"Want to make a music video?

Always interested in the role of womxn in today‚Äôs society, she likes to tell true stories of people who are close to her or even of people she has just met. Since the first approach with photography, she has tried to spread a message of inclusion, human‚Äôs body has always been objectified and aestheticized. \"We must represent the reality in which we live, where perfection does not exist: I want gender equality\". Through her photos, she would like everyone to express the right to be themselves. Her work has been published and exhibited internationally."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"Often in art schools they don't teach us how to promote our work. In this workshop, Sara will share her personal experience of how to promote your work through collaborations, Instagram and publications. She'll also demonstrate how to pitch it to potential clients and  collaborate with other creatives in order to create a collective project, such as her publishing project: Mulieris Magazine. \n\nBeing a photographer and a magazine editor, Sara had the opportunity to be on both sides: the artist who seeks collaborations and the editor who selects the work of other artists.

He‚Äôs spent the last few years creating series‚Äô that are dedicated to promoting men's mental health and normalising men speaking about their mental health with their friends and family. His ongoing 'Men-Tal Health' series included interviews and familiar faces from Actor Joe Gilgun to Danny Lomas. He's currently shooting a series documenting love and relationships across the UK.\n\nThe 25-year-old has been shooting fashion advertorials and editorials for the last two years, shooting on 35mm and medium format film.

In a moment where our relationship to nature is perhaps more tenuous¬†and distant than ever before, it is important to question how we see ourselves in nature and how we see nature without us in it. Both types of images will be included in Caleb's presentation as he explores a wide range of approaches to this topic. Questions and comments from the Daisie community are encouraged and welcomed."},{"heading":"Daisie Workshop Chat","content":"You‚Äôll be invited to join your classmates on Daisie before the Workshop begins; come say hi!\n\nThe session's zoom link will be sent via email and to the workshop chat."}]},{"name":"topImage","sectionType":"image","image":{"processorPath":"https://daisie-assets-production.accelerator.net/images/user_fYjEom96o7TACHadseRvML/media_1EkgcacPYQqmHpDFR6wnBm.jpeg;resize(1200,9999,fit).jpg"},"caption":"Personal and meaningful work from nature"}],"attributes":{"fontFamily":""}},"relationships":{"mentor":{"data":{"id":"user_eCffKWaTFkCcrk6UMswGge","type":"users","attributes":{"username":"caleb_stein","name":"Caleb Stein","bio":"\nCaleb Stein is a multimedia artist whose work explores the fragility of memory and the dynamic, energetic interactions that take place within community.

He was first exhibited at the Art Gallery of Hamilton at the age of 19 (A gallery that includes a multi-million dollar collection of 16th - 21st Century Masters).\n\nSeeking a post-secondary education that could help him achieve his dream, he was fortunate to find the Academy of Realist Art in Toronto.¬†¬†The school‚Äôs curriculum is based on the 19th Century French Academic system made famous by William Bouguereau.

Working remotely at first with independent production companies through word-of-mouth, he eventually took the plunge and approached some creative studios, which led him to an internship-come-lead-motion-designer (over the space of almost 3 years) at the Electric Theatre Collective, ETC VFX.\n\nNow leading his own studio, Greedy Goons, George divides his time in between creating commercial motion design and directorial projects within the music industry. Selected clients include: Adidas, Apple Music, Pepsi, Puma, EA, Ray-Ban, Sky, Sony Music & UMG.\n\nAside from creating and directing, George also works as a mentor, where he not only supports people with their technical skills, but also tries to demystify the visual creative industries to make them more accessible and ultimately, more fun."},{"heading":"The session","content":"In this session with George, you‚Äôll explore his 3D motion design¬†process in commercials.

Reading it differently you could have a million different perspectives, views and opinions about how it makes you feel. Since then he has used poetry as a way to express himself, as a medicine to a clogged up mind filled with thoughts and frustrations.\n\nTwo years ago, was the first time he performed in front of an audience.

His photographic work is suffused with the sun, ocean and dust-filled air of his environment, which he contrasts with the ephemeral and idiosyncratic nature of his subjects. The moments he captures are fleeting, candid, and tell a story of love and ennui, beauty and banality. This compelling visual style has made Todd a sought-after photographer in the fashion world, his images appearing in many international publications, including i-D, Purple, Self Service, POP, 032C, T Magazine, Vogue, The NY Times Style Magazine, The Fader, Art Review, and The Journal, among others. He has also published a photography book, I‚Äôm Yours To Keep (AndPress, 2012).\n\nThe strong storytelling instinct behind the photographic images inexorably led Todd back to film, where he plays with time and reality. Drawn in by the rich images and the spontaneous authentic-feeling performances, our perceptions are then turned on their heads by the introduction of something unexpected or even magical. In the trio of short films made in collaboration with the clothing label Rodarte, Todd blends high fashion with magical reality to critical acclaim.

Her work is typically created using a stippling technique in pen & ink and graphite, with occasional splashes of color. Juliet‚Äôs pieces are inspired by the ocean, nature, and all of the creatures within our world. Since the time she was a child, Juliet has been fascinated by black and white photography, colorless television shows, and film noir movies. Being exposed to the lighting effects and sharp contrasts shown in these photographs and films greatly inspired the type of work that she does today. Juliet‚Äôs work is centered around giving a voice to nature and animals, with the goal of showcasing their importance in this world. Through an illustrative take on fine art, she attempts to express a story in each drawing."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"Join this workshop with Juliet where she‚Äôll complete a small illustration showing exactly how she stipples in real-time to shade and create a final drawing.

Reading it differently you could have a million different perspectives, views and opinions about how it makes you feel. Since then he has used poetry as a way to express himself, as a medicine to a clogged up mind filled with thoughts and frustrations.\n\nTwo years ago, was the first time he performed in front of an audience. As much as it was a nerve-racking experience, his stage presence captivates audiences, leaving them entranced in his words. Since then, Alieu has been invited to multiple events to perform his poetry, that often centres around self-expression, political insights and identity."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"Looking to share your work with others?

Working remotely at first with independent production companies through word-of-mouth, he eventually took the plunge and approached some creative studios, which led him to an internship-come-lead-motion-designer (over the space of almost 3 years) at the Electric Theatre Collective, ETC VFX.\n\nNow leading his own studio, Greedy Goons, George divides his time in between creating commercial motion design and directorial projects within the music industry. Selected clients include: Adidas, Apple Music, Pepsi, Puma, EA, Ray-Ban, Sky, Sony Music & UMG.\n\nAside from creating and directing, George also works as a mentor, where he not only supports people with their technical skills, but also tries to demystify the visual creative industries to make them more accessible and ultimately, more fun."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"Graphic Designer?

He‚Äôs spent the last few years creating series‚Äô that are dedicated to promoting men's mental health and normalising men speaking about their mental health with their friends and family. His ongoing 'Men-Tal Health' series included interviews and familiar faces from Actor Joe Gilgun to Danny Lomas. He's currently shooting a series documenting love and relationships across the UK.\n\nThe 25-year-old has been shooting fashion advertorials and editorials for the last two years, shooting on 35mm and medium format film.

Working remotely at first with independent production companies through word-of-mouth, he eventually took the plunge and approached some creative studios, which led him to an internship-come-lead-motion-designer (over the space of almost 3 years) at the Electric Theatre Collective, ETC VFX.\n\nNow leading his own studio, Greedy Goons, George divides his time in between creating commercial motion design and directorial projects within the music industry. Selected clients include: Adidas, Apple Music, Pepsi, Puma, EA, Ray-Ban, Sky, Sony Music & UMG. Aside from creating and directing, George also works as a mentor, where he not only supports people with their technical skills, but also tries to demystify the visual creative industries to make them more accessible and ultimately, more fun."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"Will I ever get another job?

Walters (1992) is an interdisciplinary artist based in Prince George's County Maryland, formally based in Los Angeles, California.

Born in Canada, David began showing a talented interest in the visual arts from early childhood. During his high school years he was introduced to paintings by Rembrandt and Salvador Dali and was enamoured with the idea of creating his own paintings that would be just as beautiful and meaningful for his career. He was first exhibited at the Art Gallery of Hamilton at the age of 19 (A gallery that includes a multi-million dollar collection of 16th - 21st Century Masters).\n\nSeeking a post-secondary education that could help him achieve his dream, he was fortunate to find the Academy of Realist Art in Toronto.  The school‚Äôs curriculum is based on the 19th Century French Academic system made famous by William Bouguereau. The internationally acclaimed artist John Michael Angel started the school during the 1990‚Äôs Resurrection of Realism and the academy continues to be the only school in Canada that has kept the excellent standards established during the period of high Realism in 20th Century Europe. David graduated with honors from their 4-year program in 2012 and has continued his journey as an independent artist since."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"Why gesso? To Tone or not to Tone?

Reading it differently you could have a million different perspectives, views and opinions about how it makes you feel. Since then he has used poetry as a way to express himself, as a medicine to a clogged up mind filled with thoughts and frustrations.\n\nTwo years ago, was the first time he performed in front of an audience. As much as it was a nerve-racking experience, his stage presence captivates audiences, leaving them entranced in his words. Since then, Ali has been invited to multiple events to perform his poetry, that often centres around self-expression, political insights and identity."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"With todays different media varieties, there are so many ways to transform your writing in a way that will grasp a reader‚Äôs attention.

George","content":"After quitting his BA in Illustration at the University of Brighton in 2015, George stumbled into the freelance creative world. Initially, taking on whatever jobs came his way before finally settling as a motion designer; teaching himself 2D & 3D technical skills entirely through Youtube. Working remotely at first with independent production companies through word-of-mouth, he eventually took the plunge and approached some creative studios, which led him to an internship-come-lead-motion-designer (over the space of almost 3 years) at the Electric Theatre Collective, ETC VFX.\n\nNow leading his own studio, Greedy Goons, George divides his time in between creating commercial motion design and directorial projects within the music industry. Selected clients include: Adidas, Apple Music, Pepsi, Puma, EA, Ray-Ban, Sky, Sony Music & UMG. Aside from creating and directing, George also works as a mentor, where he not only supports people with their technical skills, but also tries to demystify the visual creative industries to make them more accessible and ultimately, more fun."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"Whether you're wanting to create a frosty elven grotto, a sci-fi cityscape or a frog-band performing in a mushroom¬†grave, 3D world building gives you the ability to quickly¬†realise and iterate on your creative vision.\n\nIn this session I will break down my frog-band concept artwork, sharing my thoughts and process regarding asset creation, texturing, lighting, rendering and compositing.\n\nI will also share some mesmerising inspiration resources and basic image theory tips for developing¬†creative ideas and successful compositions.\n\nAs always, please come with questions!"},{"heading":"Daisie Workshop Chat","content":"You‚Äôll be invited to join your classmates on Daisie before the Workshop begins.

David","content":"b. 1987 David Shepherd is a Hyperrealism Artist who paints in oil on canvas. Born in Canada, David began showing a talented interest in the visual arts from early childhood. During his high school years he was introduced to paintings by Rembrandt and Salvador Dali and was enamoured with the idea of creating his own paintings that would be just as beautiful and meaningful for his career. He was first exhibited at the Art Gallery of Hamilton at the age of 19 (A gallery that includes a multi-million dollar collection of 16th - 21st Century Masters).\n\nSeeking a post-secondary education that could help him achieve his dream, he was fortunate to find the Academy of Realist Art in Toronto. The school‚Äôs curriculum is based on the 19th Century French Academic system made famous by William Bouguereau. The internationally acclaimed artist John Michael Angel started the school during the 1990‚Äôs Resurrection of Realism and the academy continues to be the only school in Canada that has kept the excellent standards established during the period of high Realism in 20th Century Europe. David graduated with honors from their 4-year program in 2012 and has continued his journey as an independent artist since."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"You might know how to start a painting, but ever wonder how to perfect the details of your process and confidently finish you artwork?

The online environment was a gold mine of inspiration. Ever since then, I‚Äôve been doing self-studies to polish my skills and knowledge. My main source was from watching other artists draw. I tried their techniques and adjust them to my style.\n\nMy favorite subjects are characters in settings and scenery. It‚Äôs wonderful to see my ideas and stories coming to life through my painting. My style has roots in anime but I like to experiment with colors and composition.\n\nIn previous years, I had my work featured in the Dutch comic museum and local magazine AniWay.

Selected clients include: Adidas, Apple Music, Pepsi, Puma, EA, Ray-Ban, Sky, Sony Music & UMG.

He now has a 2:1 and a Leica M6.\n\nLouis enjoys documenting key issues that he‚Äôs truly passionate about. He‚Äôs spent the last few years creating series‚Äô that are dedicated to promoting men's mental health and normalising men speaking about their mental health with their friends and family. His ongoing 'Men-Tal Health' series included interviews and familiar faces from Actor Joe Gilgun to Danny Lomas. He's currently shooting a series documenting love and relationships across the UK.\n\nThe 25-year-old has been shooting fashion advertorials and editorials for the last two years, shooting on 35mm and medium format film.

Creative people tend to have a wide variety of interests, which is the foundation of creativity. A creative life is enhanced with exploration, experimentation, and wonder - so why limit yourself! Don't be torn between different creative ambitions - embrace them all and invite them into the playing field.

Keeping all the steps and elements of your work separate, you can use the tools independently, without affecting the rest of the elements of your work. You just have to keep your document organised, know the tools, and use them creatively to achieve amazing results.\n\nIn this workshop with Vicky, you'll put all this into practice; making a drawing and explaining each step and tool as you go along.\n\n*It is recommended to download Procreate to follow along in this workshop with Vicky*"},{"heading":"Daisie Workshop Chat","content":"You‚Äôll be invited to join your classmates on Daisie before the Workshop begins.

Reading it differently you could have a million different perspectives, views and opinions about how it makes you feel. Since then he has used poetry as a way to express himself, as a medicine to a clogged up mind filled with thoughts and frustrations.\n\nTwo years ago, was the first time he performed in front of an audience. As much as it was a nerve-racking experience, his stage presence captivates audiences, leaving them entranced in his words. Since then, Ali has been invited to multiple events to perform his poetry, that often centres around self-expression, political insights and identity."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"Tick tock, what can your imagination unlock when your mind is focused on the clock?

His work features many human characters, who are all rendered with singular expressiveness. He tends to use a lot of colour in his work, in a way that is reminiscent of the fluidity and spontaneity of comic¬†books. There are also traces of traditional influence in his art, especially in the bold lines he uses and the way he draws facial features, which are inspired by the religious iconography in India such as the Kalighat paintings and sculptures of Mahabalipuram.

Born in Canada, David began showing a talented interest in the visual arts from early childhood. During his high school years he was introduced to paintings by Rembrandt and Salvador Dali and was enamoured with the idea of creating his own paintings that would be just as beautiful and meaningful for his career. He was first exhibited at the Art Gallery of Hamilton at the age of 19 (A gallery that includes a multi-million dollar collection of 16th - 21st Century Masters).\n\nSeeking a post-secondary education that could help him achieve his dream, he was fortunate to find the Academy of Realist Art in Toronto. The school‚Äôs curriculum is based on the 19th Century French Academic system made famous by William Bouguereau. The internationally acclaimed artist John Michael Angel started the school during the 1990‚Äôs Resurrection of Realism and the academy continues to be the only school in Canada that has kept the excellent standards established during the period of high Realism in 20th Century Europe. David graduated with honors from their 4-year program in 2012 and has continued his journey as an independent artist since."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"Navigating creativity as an artist can be difficult especially when you struggle for inspiration.

Born in Canada, David began showing a talented interest in the visual arts from early childhood. During his high school years he was introduced to paintings by Rembrandt and Salvador Dali and was enamoured with the idea of creating his own paintings that would be just as beautiful and meaningful for his career. He was first exhibited at the Art Gallery of Hamilton at the age of 19 (A gallery that includes a multi-million dollar collection of 16th - 21st Century Masters).\n\nSeeking a post-secondary education that could help him achieve his dream, he was fortunate to find the Academy of Realist Art in Toronto. The school‚Äôs curriculum is based on the 19th Century French Academic system made famous by William Bouguereau. The internationally acclaimed artist John Michael Angel started the school during the 1990‚Äôs Resurrection of Realism and the academy continues to be the only school in Canada that has kept the excellent standards established during the period of high Realism in 20th Century Europe. David graduated with honors from their 4-year program in 2012 and has continued his journey as an independent artist since."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"NFT's have provided the key to a brand new world of possibilities.

Her cosmic vision focuses on daily objects and common feelings just to turn them into something special, as magic as life is (and the moon itself). The secret of this great success is in the empathy behind every single collage: within them human emotions always find - drop after drop - a new place to be, without losing their truth. Rather they gain a deeper meaning: while crossing images they get into the essence of a thought, the pureness of a gesture, the source of an idea and - surprise! - no word is needed.

Initially, taking on whatever jobs came his way before finally settling as a motion designer; teaching himself 2D & 3D technical skills entirely through Youtube. Working remotely at first with independent production companies through word-of-mouth, he eventually took the plunge and approached some creative studios, which led him to an internship-come-lead-motion-designer (over the space of almost 3 years) at the Electric Theatre Collective, ETC VFX.\n\nNow leading his own studio, Greedy Goons, George divides his time in between creating commercial motion design and directorial projects within the music industry. Selected clients include: Adidas, Apple Music, Pepsi, Puma, EA, Ray-Ban, Sky, Sony Music & UMG. Aside from creating and directing, George also works as a mentor, where he not only supports people with their technical skills, but also tries to demystify the visual creative industries to make them more accessible and ultimately, more fun."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"In this workshop, George will present his experiences¬†building his creative studio, Greedy Goons, from a teenage art blog to his successful business and primary form of income.\n\nUsing his career history as an example, he will discuss his thoughts regarding project management, self marketing, client communication, financial health and happiness!\n\nGeorge wouldn't call himself an expert business owner, but he‚Äôs definitely learnt a lot along the way that he'd like to share with the Daisie community.\n\nAs always, please come with questions!"},{"heading":"Daisie Workshop Chat","content":"You‚Äôll be invited to join your classmates on Daisie before the Workshop begins.
