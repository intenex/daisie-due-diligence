Reading it differently you could have a million different perspectives, views and opinions about how it makes you feel. Since then he has used poetry as a way to express himself, as a medicine to a clogged up mind filled with thoughts and frustrations.\n\nTwo years ago, was the first time he performed in front of an audience. As much as it was a nerve-racking experience, his stage presence captivates audiences, leaving them entranced in his words.

Reading it differently you could have a million different perspectives, views and opinions about how it makes you feel. Since then he has used poetry as a way to express himself, as a medicine to a clogged up mind filled with thoughts and frustrations.\n\nTwo years ago, was the first time he performed in front of an audience.

Butters has participated in over 40 group shows and 15 solo shows across Canada.  \n She is fascinated by the subconscious and influenced by surrealism and expressionism. She has studied under many prominent contemporary artists such as: Jennifer Hornyak, Marilyn Rubenstein, Seymour Segel, Shirley Kats, Philip Iverson, Sophie Jodoin, and Jacques Clement.  She was also inspired by the revolutionary Canadian artist, Paul-Émile Borduas.\n\nBorduas created a very different vision of life and art with his spontaneous expressions of emotions, feelings, and sensations.  While his work was considered radical at the time, Butter’s work is seen as joyful explosions of colour and emotion.  Her evolution and exuberant exploration of colour and composition make her still-lifes and landscapes flamboyant and exciting.\n\nValerie attended the Ottawa School of Art in 2001 and, in 2005, graduated from a three-year Comprehensive Arts Program at the Saidye Bronfman Centre, in Montreal, where she received art scholarships in 2003 and in 2004.  Her quick evolution and exploration of colour and compositions resides in her still-lifes and landscapes.  Her large formats and flamboyant style have caught the eye of art critics such as Henry Lehmann of the Montréal Gazette (11 September 2004) who described her work as “…interestingly gaudy, exuberantly messy…”"},{"heading":"The Session","content":"Tricks on how to get out of the stiffness trap.\n\nValerie Butters will cover some ideas on how to approach a canvas in a different way, offering some of her best tricks and tips."},{"heading":"Daisie Workshop Chat","content":"You’ll be invited to join your classmates on Daisie before the Workshop begins.

Her career pathway has weaved and wined through the right avenues to get her into the wonderful world of coaching.\n\nJessica set up her coaching practice because she spent years looking as if she ran a successful business. Technically it was and still is successful, she has designed for the likes of Vogue, BBC, ITV, Christian Louboutin, Selfridges, Mulberry and Google and has been featured in Stylist, Vogue, GQ, Creative review, Tatler and Harpers Bazaar.\n\nOutwardly she was achieving great success, but internally she was creating from a place of fear, working all the hours and judging herself. She thought being hard on herself was an admirable trait.\n\nEventually, her design business took off when she cleaned up her mindset.\n\nShe doesn't subscribe to the hustle mentality, if you asked her about that a few years ago she probably would have told you she invented it. The biggest news she ever heard was ‘it doesn't have to be hard’\nJessica is here to help you build a life and business that is joyful, impactful and financially sustainable.\n\nShe has had a long held love for podcasts about business, psychology and coaching, spending a good few years sharing business and mindset tips through social media.\n\nJessica went on to work with coaching with the intention of growing her design business, however that is when everything changed for her.\n\nUntil Jessica got coached she had never been able to admit to herself that she wanted to be a coach, after working through some mindset blocks and answering some tricky questions she was finally honest with herself - deciding to make the biggest self-investment to date, deciding to get certified as a life coach.\n\nFully showing up for herself and supporting and nurturing herself, she now wants to help you do the same."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"Do you want to make more money?

He’s spent the last few years creating series’ that are dedicated to promoting men's mental health and normalising men speaking about their mental health with their friends and family.

He's currently shooting a series documenting love and relationships across the UK.\n\nThe 25-year-old has been shooting fashion advertorials and editorials for the last two years, shooting on 35mm and medium format film.

Initially, taking on whatever jobs came his way, he worked as an illustrator, graphic designer, photographic assistant, editor, club promoter, and West Ham FC/Monster Energy human-merch-mannequin, before finally settling as a motion designer; teaching himself 2D & 3D technical skills entirely through Youtube. Working remotely at first with independent production companies through word-of-mouth, he eventually took the plunge and approached some creative studios, which led him to an internship-come-lead-motion-designer (over the space of almost 3 years) at the Electric Theatre Collective, ETC VFX.\n\nNow leading his own studio, Greedy Goons, George divides his time in between creating commercial motion design and directorial projects within the music industry. Selected clients include: Adidas, Apple Music, Pepsi, Puma, EA, Ray-Ban, Sky, Sony Music & UMG.\n\nAside from creating and directing, George also works as a mentor, where he not only supports people with their technical skills, but also tries to demystify the visual creative industries to make them more accessible and ultimately, more fun."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"For this workshop, George will talk through the design process for creating an event flyer for a club night.\nHe'll introduce the brand identity for GÆZ - an experimental club night in London that he collaborated on and managed for many years.\n\nHe will also analyse the decisions that lead to different creative outcomes: posters, flyers, videos, 3D, before breaking down the exact Photoshop process he used to create the promotional flyers for the event GÆZ: snowflæk.\n\nThere's going to be a lot of wacky content in this workshop paired nicely with some crisp technical tutorials.\n\nIt will help to fire you up and demonstrate that ideas don't have to be perfect to have value.

Reading it differently you could have a million different perspectives, views and opinions about how it makes you feel. Since then he has used poetry as a way to express himself, as a medicine to a clogged up mind filled with thoughts and frustrations.\n\nTwo years ago, was the first time he performed in front of an audience. As much as it was a nerve-racking experience, his stage presence captivates audiences, leaving them entranced in his words. Since then, Ali has been invited to multiple events to perform his poetry, that often centres around self-expression, political insights and identity."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"This workshop is all about spending less time staring at a blank piece of paper and actually getting your thoughts out of your head.

Reading it differently you could have a million different perspectives, views and opinions about how it makes you feel. Since then he has used poetry as a way to express himself, as a medicine to a clogged up mind filled with thoughts and frustrations.\n\nTwo years ago, was the first time he performed in front of an audience. As much as it was a nerve-racking experience, his stage presence captivates audiences, leaving them entranced in his words.

Gaining an interest in image-making in their teenage years, they have since used photography as space to both experiment with, and document identity as it comes to be expressed through gender.\n\nLaurence's practise celebrates trans existence and studies identity as a space in constant flux via high-saturated, cinematic, vulnerable images.

He fell in love with poetry around the age of 10, whilst he was studying in secondary school.\n\nHe became addicted to writing poetry when he realised the way one poem could have a million different meanings through interpretation. Reading it differently you could have a million different perspectives, views and opinions about how it makes you feel. Since then he has used poetry as a way to express himself, as a medicine to a clogged up mind filled with thoughts and frustrations.\n\nTwo years ago, was the first time he performed in front of an audience. As much as it was a nerve-racking experience, his stage presence captivates audiences, leaving them entranced in his words. Since then, Ali has been invited to multiple events to perform his poetry, that often centres around self-expression, political insights and identity."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"If you write, if you like listening to those who do write, if you want to gain some inspiration, or if you just want a safe space to build your confidence and test your new piece of writing then Ali encourages you to attend this workshop, because it will allow you to do all of that!

The internationally acclaimed artist John Michael Angel started the school during the 1990’s Resurrection of Realism and the academy continues to be the only school in Canada that has kept the excellent standards established during the period of high Realism in 20th Century Europe. Translating those skills into a contemporary style, he has produced a stunning series of Hyper Realism paintings that are breathtakingly real, while extremely relaxing and beautiful to look at. He currently is represented by galleries across North America and has works in private collections around the world."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"An introduction into the language, the concepts, and the examples of how you take an empty white canvas and turn it into a masterpiece.

Since graduating, she has had the opportunity to interview many well-known artists for a variety of publications and always felt like art was her calling but was put-off by the traditional gallery, auction house models which value financial gains over the development of artistic talent. \nWhen the Black Lives Matter protests took off in the Summer of 2020 she felt called to contribute to the movement in a meaningful way, Purslane was the result. Siddick organised a big fundraiser for The Stephen Lawrence Trust, featuring the work of upcoming and emerging artists which went on to raise over £5000. She has gone on to continue organising monthly art fundraisers that benefit different charitable causes, working with a huge network of young artists at the start of their careers."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"Charlie will be talking about how her business naturally evolved and grew from harnessing her passions and belief systems.

He studied anthropology at UCL and started his photographic journey in 2012. He believes the camera is an ideal tool for exploring emotions. His first photo book called Metropolight captured and analysed how modern architecture can make us feel. His images are driven by a search for light and a curiosity about the effects of colours and shapes on the human mind. Following the success of his book and an exhibition commissioned by the city of Prague, David has focused on teaching photography workshops at home and around the world. Recently, he also started exploring the relationship between photography and music in order to help him teach photography more effectively.  Since the beginning of the pandemic, he runs workshops online and focuses on helping his students become more attuned to the world around them. His work has been published in numerous media, including The Guardian or the Spanish El País."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"A photographer’s skill depends on the ability to perceive light and understand the effects of light on our emotions.

Art, in all its manifestations, from music to cinema, but also going through painting, literature, comic and photography has become the way Luis Kav can unleash his creativity and imagination in order to create new worlds, besides it’s the path to express his inner world, his feelings, thoughts and reflections.\nTherefore, he has always ensured to experiment, discover and explore new forms of expression. This is, precisely, what led him to photography. Almost by chance it crossed his path while he wandered through the illustration world, and he decided to stay and try, at least for a while.\nEugenio Recuenco, Gregory Crewdson, Bradford Young, Roger Deakins, Simon Stalenhag or Darius Khondji are some of those who were responsible for my choice of photography as a way of expression. All these artists have in common a series of aesthetics reminiscent of other artistic methods, such as a cinematographic lighting or an excellent pictorial composition, but above all they express a concept, or a feeling embraced by an extremely careful artistic sensibility."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"In this workshop, Luis will dive into how to differentiate your work from others by mixing different disciplines from the art universe."},{"heading":"Daisie Workshop Chat","content":"You’ll be invited to join your classmates on Daisie before the Workshop begins.

Gaining an interest in image-making in their teenage years, they have since used photography as space to both experiment with, and document identity as it comes to be expressed through gender.\n\nLaurence's practise celebrates trans existence and studies identity as a space in constant flux via high-saturated, cinematic, vulnerable images.

Reading it differently you could have a million different perspectives, views and opinions about how it makes you feel. Since then he has used poetry as a way to express himself, as a medicine to a clogged up mind filled with thoughts and frustrations.\n\nTwo years ago, was the first time he performed in front of an audience.

Working remotely at first with independent production companies through word-of-mouth, he eventually took the plunge and approached some creative studios, which led him to an internship-come-lead-motion-designer (over the space of almost 3 years) at the Electric Theatre Collective, ETC VFX.\n\nNow leading his own studio, Greedy Goons, George divides his time in between creating commercial motion design and directorial projects within the music industry. Selected clients include: Adidas, Apple Music, Pepsi, Puma, EA, Ray-Ban, Sky, Sony Music & UMG.\n\nAside from creating and directing, George also works as a mentor, where he not only supports people with their technical skills, but also tries to demystify the visual creative industries to make them more accessible and ultimately, more fun.\n\nGG"},{"heading":"The Session","content":"In this encore session, George Dyson of Greedy Goons will be taking inspiration from Snootie Studios' speed process workshop in which they created a randomly generated project outcome from scratch within the hour session.\n\nYou're invited to follow along as George researches, designs and animates a logo for a randomly generated concept brand.\n\nGeorge will stream their design and animation processes from start to finish whilst answering your questions live.\n\nTogether you're going to make something cool, we just don't know what it is yet...\n\nSee you there!"},{"heading":"Daisie Workshop Chat","content":"You’ll be invited to join your classmates on Daisie before the Workshop begins.

Her purpose is to be herself so authentically and colourfully that she connects, inspires and add flavours to all the spaces she occupies. She's been through a lot of phases and has tried plenty of things. \n\nRachael is a writer, content creator, model, stylist/hairstylist, dog walker/trainer, nail designer & playlist curator. Not everything she does generates income but everything she does generates fulfilment and happiness. With each hobby she chooses to embark on, she moves with integrity and a genuine approach. By embodying those two important tools, she makes new connections and gains more success with each experience. \n\nAfter high school, she went to college for Fashion Marketing and Merchandising where she obtained an associates degree. She never finished college but she used what she learned to explore all her talents and further herself in the creative spaces she gravitated towards. The best part about all of this is, she's still figuring it out, but she'll be damned if she doesn't have a fun time exploring it all."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"In this session, Rachael will break down the imperfect unconventional journey creatives endure to find themselves.

Reading it differently you could have a million different perspectives, views and opinions about how it makes you feel. Since then he has used poetry as a way to express himself, as a medicine to a clogged up mind filled with thoughts and frustrations.\n\nTwo years ago, was the first time he performed in front of an audience.

Thus, we are taught to believe that there are good people who choose to do good and bad people who choose to do evil. But what if this whole conception of our humanity was nothing but a superstitious belief that is radically different from reality and our true nature?\n\nSpinoza, centuries before the emergence of biology and neuroscience, challenges everything we thought we knew about reality, about humanity, about morality, about our free will, and opens our eyes to new ways of looking at the world and our place in it. Today, his lessons remain extremely current and continue to be valuable in teaching us how to navigate our personal lives efficiently.\n\nIn this workshop, Rabih will explore some of humanity's age-old questions that were just as pressing over two thousand years ago as they still are today.

Reading it differently you could have a million different perspectives, views and opinions about how it makes you feel. Since then he has used poetry as a way to express himself, as a medicine to a clogged up mind filled with thoughts and frustrations.\n\nTwo years ago, was the first time he performed in front of an audience. As much as it was a nerve-racking experience, his stage presence captivates audiences, leaving them entranced in his words. Since then, Ali has been invited to multiple events to perform his poetry, which often centres around self-expression, political insights and identity."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"In this workshop, Ali will give the floor to those attending.

She's been through a lot of phases and has tried plenty of things.\n\nRachael is a writer, content creator, model, stylist/hairstylist, dog walker/trainer, nail designer & playlist curator. Not everything she does generates income but everything she does generates fulfilment and happiness. With each hobby she chooses to embark on, she moves with integrity and a genuine approach. By embodying those two important tools, she makes new connections and gains more success with each experience.\n\nAfter high school, she went to college for Fashion Marketing and Merchandising where she obtained an associates degree. She never finished college but she used what she learned to explore all her talents and further herself in the creative spaces she gravitated towards. The best part about all of this is, she's still figuring it out, but she'll be damned if she doesn't have a fun time exploring it all."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"In this workshop, Rachael will give you a step by step view of how she creates her Instagram stories.

By virtue of this most random timing, portrait photographer Wesley Verhoeve found himself stuck in a place he’s never been to before. A small but beautiful suburban neighbourhood of Vancouver was to be his home for the first 5 months of the pandemic.\n\nEverything that was his “normal” suddenly changed to its opposite. Instead of travelling the globe, he was contained in one neighbourhood. Instead of meeting and photographing random people all day long, he’d walk for hours without seeing more than a handful of humans. Instead of his busy client work schedule, his inbox was quiet and days blended together. So, he started walking. Every day, a few hours, camera in hand. It became his meditative practice and helped ground him in a world where everything suddenly seemed uncertain. Wesley walked around his small neighbourhood for 123 consecutive days. He practised slowing down and paying attention so he could see better. Suddenly his world, which had initially felt so small, was revealed to be a massive universe with tiny stories everywhere.\n\nMental roadblocks,  unexpected circumstances and lack of inspiration happen to all creatives. In the first workshop of a 2-part series, Wesley will discuss how to turn a creative habit into a project."},{"heading":"Daisie Workshop Chat","content":"You’ll be invited to join your classmates on Daisie before the Workshop begins.

She tries to explore the injunctions, contradictions and grotesques of our societies. She disguises her melancholy behind the blue sky and colourful pictures. Gil believes humour is elegance. Beauty is relative to cultures, epochs, conventions and by this means it becomes plural.\n\nBut where are we? Paradoxically, where the aesthetic discourse extends, in art the quest for beauty seems to decline. Every day she asks herself the question of the beauty of tomorrow and how it reinvents itself. She is at the beginning of the journey, full of desires, projects and images in mind."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"In this workshop, Gil Anselmi will detail how to make it as a fashion photographer, delving into the importance of and the ways in which you can direct viewer interpretation."},{"heading":"Daisie Workshop Chat","content":"You’ll be invited to join your classmates on Daisie before the Workshop begins.

Initially, taking on whatever jobs came his way, he worked as an illustrator, graphic designer, photographic assistant, editor, club promoter, and West Ham FC/Monster Energy human-merch-mannequin, before finally settling as a motion designer; teaching himself 2D & 3D technical skills entirely through Youtube. Working remotely at first with independent production companies through word-of-mouth, he eventually took the plunge and approached some creative studios, which led him to an internship-come-lead-motion-designer (over the space of almost 3 years) at the Electric Theatre Collective, ETC VFX.\n\nNow leading his own studio, Greedy Goons, George divides his time in between creating commercial motion design and directorial projects within the music industry. Selected clients include Adidas, Apple Music, Pepsi, Puma, EA, Ray-Ban, Sky, Sony Music & UMG.\n\nAside from creating and directing, George also works as a mentor, where he not only supports people with their technical skills but also tries to demystify the visual creative industries to make them more accessible and ultimately, more fun."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"In this session, George Dyson of Greedy Goons will be adding to his previous Motion Design Speed Sessions with a more in-depth look at the history and best practices of logo design. \n\nHe will present different ideas and approaches as to what makes a ‘good’ logo as well as discuss how graphics identities can be applied throughout a multitude of conventional and emerging media to create an exciting brand, such as his recent work on Neighbourhood Recordings’ new logo.\n\nIf you’ve been following along with George, you might recognise two of the design case studies that he created in previous workshops ‘Xtreme Posh’ and ‘Rap Glee’. These brands and identities will form the basis of the following two practical sessions where he will polish them off and turn them into slick 2D and 3D animations in After Effects and Cinema 4D respectively.\n\nAs always, George is excited to hear all your questions, so come caffeinated and ready.\n\nSee you there!"},{"heading":"Daisie Workshop Chat","content":"You’ll be invited to join your classmates on Daisie before the Workshop begins.

Daily objects or common landscapes are, for the artist, symbols of connection between interiority and materiality. The outside world is faced and represented through suspended atmospheres, bringing the viewer into a spaceless and timeless experience. Working in both staged and spontaneous photography, combining meticulously location, colors and composition, with a particular attention on subtraction and reduction to the essential. \n\nIn 2014, Benedetta was mentioned by the magazine Vanity Fair in the Emerging Photographers section. In 2015 Benedetta was one of the finalists of the ‘Next Photographer Award’ by D&AD in partnership with Getty Images. In 2016 one photo of her project “Lay Off” was the winner of the People category in the 16th Smithsonian Magazine photo contest. In 2015 she began the series ‘East’ ended in 2018. In 2017 she was one of the 100 creative chosen to represent the Lazio region in the annual initiative “Lazio Creativo 2017”.  In 2018 she self-published her first book “East”, from the homonymous series. In 2020 her project about quarantine in Rome is one of the winners of “Refocus” by MiBact in collaboration with the Museum of Contemporary Photography and Triennale Milano. Her works have been used to illustrate articles in Vice, Bloomberg Businessweek, Forbes, Label Magazine, Document Journal and others. She has worked commercially for clients like Airbnb, Fendi, Nike, Action Aid International. Her projects are exposed in various international exhibitions."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"Long-term photographic projects can be planned or arise spontaneously over time. The deepening of a story requires time and elaboration, for this reason, especially in documentary photography, bodies of work are created over longer periods in what is called “slow photojournalism”.\n\nTo pursue an idea and put it into practice over the years requires planning, perseverance and determination.\nIn the first session, Benedetta will talk about the core starting points: creative development, research and the production plan."},{"heading":"Daisie Workshop Chat","content":"You’ll be invited to join your classmates on Daisie before the Workshop begins.

Her purpose is to be herself so authentically and colourfully that she connects, inspires and add flavours to all the spaces she occupies. She's been through a lot of phases and has tried plenty of things.\n\nRachael is a writer, content creator, model, stylist/hairstylist, dog walker/trainer, nail designer & playlist curator. Not everything she does generates income but everything she does generates fulfilment and happiness. With each hobby she chooses to embark on, she moves with integrity and a genuine approach. By embodying those two important tools, she makes new connections and gains more success with each experience.\n\nAfter high school, she went to college for Fashion Marketing and Merchandising where she obtained an associates degree. She never finished college but she used what she learned to explore all her talents and further herself in the creative spaces she gravitated towards. The best part about all of this is, she's still figuring it out, but she'll be damned if she doesn't have a fun time exploring it all."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"In this workshop, Rachael will show you a step by step guide to creating the funky creative press on nail set of your dreams.

From working within the collaborative spirit of your production team, to learning when and how to come to agreements over final production with the client and the most important one, how to use analytical thinking to resolve last-minute problems on set.\n\nIn this workshop, Nadia will discuss how to pitch your ideas.

Reading it differently you could have a million different perspectives, views and opinions about how it makes you feel. Since then he has used poetry as a way to express himself, as a medicine to a clogged up mind filled with thoughts and frustrations.\n\nTwo years ago, was the first time he performed in front of an audience.

Despite this uncomfortable, obvious fact, the humanist tradition has never stopped believing in the existence of intrinsic goodness to human nature. That human beings are essentially good, and every evil act is nothing but an imperfection, a skid, a failure to conform to our true nature. This is why we use adjectives like \"inhuman\" to describe shocking acts of cruelty, accusing their perpetrators of being monsters, refusing to accept them within our definition of humanity.\n\nAnd yet, looking at the world today, we can't help but notice the utter failure of the moral aspirations of our civilization. Humanism - a term that for a long time carried a noble meaning - seems obsolete, maybe even naive, or delusional. What if our whole morality was based on a complete misunderstanding of our true human nature, which is why it's doomed to fail?"},{"heading":"About Navigating Life","content":"Navigating Life is an accessible practical philosophy series that covers some of humanity's age-old questions that were just as pressing over two thousand years ago as they still are today."},{"heading":"Daisie Workshop Chat","content":"You’ll be invited to join your classmates on Daisie before the Workshop begins.

Benedetta","content":"Benedetta Ristori is a freelance photographer currently based in Italy. Her work is focused on the tension between a form and the space it takes and where it’s contained by. Daily objects or common landscapes are, for the artist, symbols of connection between interiority and materiality. The outside world is faced and represented through suspended atmospheres, bringing the viewer into a spaceless and timeless experience. Working in both staged and spontaneous photography, combining meticulously location, colors and composition, with a particular attention on subtraction and reduction to the essential. \nIn 2014, Benedetta was mentioned by the magazine Vanity Fair in the Emerging Photographers section. In 2015 Benedetta was one of the finalists of the ‘Next Photographer Award’ by D&AD in partnership with Getty Images. In 2016 one photo of her project “Lay Off” was the winner of the People category in the 16th Smithsonian Magazine photo contest. In 2015 she began the series ‘East’ ended in 2018. In 2017 she was one of the 100 creative chosen to represent the Lazio region in the annual initiative “Lazio Creativo 2017”.  In 2018 she self-published her first book “East”, from the homonymous series. In 2020 her project about quarantine in Rome is one of the winners of “Refocus” by MiBact in collaboration with the Museum of Contemporary Photography and Triennale Milano.

Working remotely at first with independent production companies through word-of-mouth, he eventually took the plunge and approached some creative studios, which led him to an internship-come-lead-motion-designer (over the space of almost 3 years) at the Electric Theatre Collective, ETC VFX.\n\nNow leading his own studio, Greedy Goons, George divides his time in between creating commercial motion design and directorial projects within the music industry. Selected clients include Adidas, Apple Music, Pepsi, Puma, EA, Ray-Ban, Sky, Sony Music & UMG.\n\nAside from creating and directing, George also works as a mentor, where he not only supports people with their technical skills but also tries to demystify the visual creative industries to make them more accessible and ultimately, more fun."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"In this session, George Dyson of Greedy Goons will be adding to his previous design workshops with an in-depth look at 2D motion graphics using After Effects.

Then, it’s down to you to vote on a motion logo and George will break down exactly how he made it. If there’s time, he might even do two.\n\nFollowing this session, George is going to take the 2D logo animations we’ve made and demonstrate how to turn them into shiny 3D assets using Cinema 4D.\n\nAs always, George is excited to hear all your questions, so come caffeinated and ready.\n\nSee you there!"},{"heading":"Daisie Workshop Chat","content":"You’ll be invited to join your classmates on Daisie before the Workshop begins.

Reading it differently you could have a million different perspectives, views and opinions about how it makes you feel. Since then he has used poetry as a way to express himself, as a medicine to a clogged up mind filled with thoughts and frustrations.\n\nTwo years ago, was the first time he performed in front of an audience. As much as it was a nerve-racking experience, his stage presence captivates audiences, leaving them entranced in his words.

Her work is focused on the tension between a form and the space it takes and where it’s contained by. Daily objects or common landscapes are, for the artist, symbols of connection between interiority and materiality. The outside world is faced and represented through suspended atmospheres, bringing the viewer into a spaceless and timeless experience. Working in both staged and spontaneous photography, combining meticulously location, colors and composition, with a particular attention on subtraction and reduction to the essential.\nIn 2014, Benedetta was mentioned by the magazine Vanity Fair in the Emerging Photographers section. In 2015 Benedetta was one of the finalists of the ‘Next Photographer Award’ by D&AD in partnership with Getty Images. In 2016 one photo of her project “Lay Off” was the winner of the People category in the 16th Smithsonian Magazine photo contest. In 2015 she began the series ‘East’ ended in 2018. In 2017 she was one of the 100 creative chosen to represent the Lazio region in the annual initiative “Lazio Creativo 2017”. In 2018 she self-published her first book “East”, from the homonymous series. In 2020 her project about quarantine in Rome is one of the winners of “Refocus” by MiBact in collaboration with the Museum of Contemporary Photography and Triennale Milano. Her works have been used to illustrate articles in Vice, Bloomberg Businessweek, Forbes, Label Magazine, Document Journal and others. She has worked commercially for clients like Airbnb, Fendi, Nike, Action Aid International. Her projects are exposed in various international exhibitions."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"Long-term photographic projects can be planned or arise spontaneously over time.

His work has been featured in various print and online publications.\nAs a child born in the Dominican Republic, Espaillat always had a passion for photography. He would spend much of his time capturing photos of his peers and surroundings. Yet, it was his move in 2012 to New York City that inspired him to stop studying medicine and pursue his love.

Reading it differently you could have a million different perspectives, views and opinions about how it makes you feel. Since then he has used poetry as a way to express himself, as a medicine to a clogged up mind filled with thoughts and frustrations.\n\nTwo years ago, was the first time he performed in front of an audience.

Since then she has gone on to make a number of short and feature length documentaries, such as God Children, which won best Documentary in the Middle East and licensed to a number of international countries. She is now in the development of her net film, the Doctor & His Daughters. \n\nReshel is a lecturer in film and media with over ten years of experience in higher education. She has taught and advised students on a number of units/modules which include cinematography, Producing and Documentary production. She is currently the Programme Leader for MA Production Management at University of Salford."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"This is a 4-part series about the best ways to write a treatment for a documentary film.\n\nSince the change of active streaming platforms, the documentary genre has become very popular allowing more people to want to capture real-life stories for an audience.\n\nBefore starting production, it is key to have a treatment created for the documentary. Even though documentaries do not have scripts, the treatment lays out the narrative based on research, observation, time with contributors and intuition. A treatment is required when a filmmaker plans to have a crew on board, pitching to funders, applying for grants and barter deals if needed.\n\nThe treatment lets the filmmaker unfold the narrative, the cinematic feel, the mode and the emotional point of the film. It’s a great way for the filmmaker to understand and depict the production and final film.\n\nThis four-part session will allow the Daisie community to have a better understanding of how treatment writing is created and building self-confidence.\n\nBefore starting to write the treatment the filmmaker/writer must be confident with the narrative. In this session, Reshel will break down the visual, technical and narrative attributes to think of when developing the narrative. Reshel will look into what makes a narrative stand out in documentary production, followed by certain story points to think of including locations, contributors and the message.

Working remotely at first with independent production companies through word-of-mouth, he eventually took the plunge and approached some creative studios, which led him to an internship-come-lead-motion-designer (over the space of almost 3 years) at the Electric Theatre Collective, ETC VFX.\n\nNow leading his own studio, Greedy Goons, George divides his time in between creating commercial motion design and directorial projects within the music industry. Selected clients include Adidas, Apple Music, Pepsi, Puma, EA, Ray-Ban, Sky, Sony Music & UMG.\n\nAside from creating and directing, George also works as a mentor, where he not only supports people with their technical skills but also tries to demystify the visual creative industries to make them more accessible and ultimately, more fun."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"In the final workshop of this series, George Dyson of Greedy Goons will finish his logo design journey by creating a shiny 3D logo animation in C4D.\n\nHe will present some 3D logo animations for the best brands ever: ‘Xtreme Posh’ and ‘Rap Glee’.

Each color represents a number, and when numbers are used to illustrate time the painting appears as a layered image, a representation of time.

He fell in love with poetry around the age of 10, whilst he was studying in secondary school.\n\nHe became addicted to writing poetry when he realised the way one poem could have a million different meanings through interpretation. Reading it differently you could have a million different perspectives, views and opinions about how it makes you feel. Since then he has used poetry as a way to express himself, as a medicine to a clogged up mind filled with thoughts and frustrations.\n\nTwo years ago, was the first time he performed in front of an audience. As much as it was a nerve-racking experience, his stage presence captivates audiences, leaving them entranced in his words. Since then, Ali has been invited to multiple events to perform his poetry, which often centres around self-expression, political insights and identity."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"In this workshop with Ali, you'll explore the difference between performing a piece of poetry or spoken word online versus live performance.

She is currently the Programme Leader for MA Production Management at University of Salford."},{"heading":"The Series","content":"This is a 4-part series about the best ways to write a treatment for a documentary film.\n\nSince the change of active streaming platforms, the documentary genre has become very popular allowing more people to want to capture real-life stories for an audience.\n\nBefore starting production, it is key to have a treatment created for the documentary. Even though documentaries do not have scripts, the treatment lays out the narrative based on research, observation, time with contributors and intuition. A treatment is required when a filmmaker plans to have a crew on board, pitching to funders, applying for grants and barter deals if needed.\n\nThe treatment lets the filmmaker unfold the narrative, the cinematic feel, the mode and the emotional point of the film. It’s a great way for the filmmaker to understand and depict the production and final film.\n\nThis four-part session will allow the Daisie community to have a better understanding of how treatment writing is created and building self-confidence."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"In the second workshop of a 4-part series, Reshel will break down the first part of treatment writing for a documentary.

His first photobook called [Metropolight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_buKi6I0IXk&ab_channel=DavidGaberle) captured and analysed how modern architecture can make us feel. His images are driven by a search for light and a curiosity about the effects of colours and shapes on the human mind. Following the success of his book and an exhibition commissioned by the city of Prague, David has focused on teaching photography workshops at home and around the world.Recently, he also started exploring the relationship between photography and music in order to help him teach photography more effectively.  Since the beginning of the pandemic, he runs workshops online and focuses on helping his students become more attuned to the world around them. His work has been published in numerous media, including The Guardian or the Spanish El País."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"A photographer’s skill depends on the ability to perceive light and understand the effects of light on our emotions.

His work has also been tapped for use in album artwork, news coverage, & promotional materials for musicians, venues, events, & corporate clients in a variety of print & online media.

He fell in love with poetry around the age of 10, whilst he was studying in secondary school.\n\nHe became addicted to writing poetry when he realised the way one poem could have a million different meanings through interpretation. Reading it differently you could have a million different perspectives, views and opinions about how it makes you feel. Since then he has used poetry as a way to express himself, as a medicine to a clogged up mind filled with thoughts and frustrations.\n\nTwo years ago, was the first time he performed in front of an audience. As much as it was a nerve-racking experience, his stage presence captivates audiences, leaving them entranced in his words.

For her, makeup artistry is a way for her to can express herself, her feelings, thoughts, and her very essence as an artist. Makeup is one of the tools of creativity that allow her to reveal what she feels the best and she really appreciates the evolution of makeup within the fashion industry for that. \nArt and fashion are her biggest inspiration and the way she uses different tools, textures, colours, and concepts reflect that in her work. Beauty is everywhere regardless of gender, race, sexuality or culture and it is Elisabeth's mission to bring that realisation to the world.\nIf she could give an aspiring makeup artist one piece of advice it would be to always follow your gut feeling and do what makes you feel not only happy but complete. People will always judge but use this as fuel for your burning passion.

Since then she has gone on to make a number of short and feature length documentaries, such as God Children, which won best Documentary in the Middle East and licensed to a number of international countries. She is now in the development of her net film, the Doctor & His Daughters. \n\nReshel is a lecturer in film and media with over ten years of experience in higher education. She has taught and advised students on a number of units/modules which include cinematography, Producing and Documentary production. She is currently the Programme Leader for MA Production Management at University of Salford."},{"heading":"The Series","content":"This is a 4-part series about the best ways to write a treatment for a documentary film.\n\nSince the change of active streaming platforms, the documentary genre has become very popular allowing more people to want to capture real-life stories for an audience.\n\nBefore starting production, it is key to have a treatment created for the documentary. Even though documentaries do not have scripts, the treatment lays out the narrative based on research, observation, time with contributors and intuition. A treatment is required when a filmmaker plans to have a crew on board, pitching to funders, applying for grants and barter deals if needed.\n\nThe treatment lets the filmmaker unfold the narrative, the cinematic feel, the mode and the emotional point of the film. It’s a great way for the filmmaker to understand and depict the production and final film.\n\nThis four-part session will allow the Daisie community to have a better understanding of how treatment writing is created and building self-confidence."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"They say act two is the most important part of the film and treatment writing.

He studied anthropology at UCL and started his photographic journey in 2012. He believes the camera is an ideal tool for exploring emotions. His first photobook called [Metropolight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_buKi6I0IXk&ab_channel=DavidGaberle) captured and analysed how modern architecture can make us feel. His images are driven by a search for light and a curiosity about the effects of colours and shapes on the human mind. Following the success of his book and an exhibition commissioned by the city of Prague, David has focused on teaching photography workshops at home and around the world.Recently, he also started exploring the relationship between photography and music in order to help him teach photography more effectively.  Since the beginning of the pandemic, he runs workshops online and focuses on helping his students become more attuned to the world around them. His work has been published in numerous media, including The Guardian or the Spanish El País."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"One of the biggest challenges of photography nowadays is to create images that look different from what we have all seen online already. At a time of affordable technology and infinite processing possibilities, the first step that will help your images stand out is the ability to look at the world in a unique and personal way. The second important step is knowing how to translate this into your photographs.\n\nThe first part of the workshop will therefore focus on how to unlearn our habitual ways of seeing the world. This unlearning is facilitated by regular practice so we will also discuss in detail how to be able to shoot regularly without letting our critical voice take over and make us stop taking photos. The second part of the workshop focuses on how to use the camera to open up to new ways of seeing. The combination of these two sections will give you the tools for regular shooting practice that helps you develop your own vision. This lesson is structured to help you make use of the camera as a magical box that holds the potential to turn the world into a playground of your own making."},{"heading":"Daisie Workshop Chat","content":"You’ll be invited to join your classmates on Daisie before the Workshop begins.

Since then she has gone on to make a number of short and feature length documentaries, such as God Children, which won best Documentary in the Middle East and licensed to a number of international countries. She is now in the development of her net film, the Doctor & His Daughters.\n\nReshel is a lecturer in film and media with over ten years of experience in higher education.

She is currently the Programme Leader for MA Production Management at University of Salford."},{"heading":"The Series","content":"This is a 4-part series about the best ways to write a treatment for a documentary film.\n\nSince the change of active streaming platforms, the documentary genre has become very popular allowing more people to want to capture real-life stories for an audience.\n\nBefore starting production, it is key to have a treatment created for the documentary. Even though documentaries do not have scripts, the treatment lays out the narrative based on research, observation, time with contributors and intuition. A treatment is required when a filmmaker plans to have a crew on board, pitching to funders, applying for grants and barter deals if needed.\n\nThe treatment lets the filmmaker unfold the narrative, the cinematic feel, the mode and the emotional point of the film. It’s a great way for the filmmaker to understand and depict the production and final film.\n\nThis four-part session will allow the Daisie community to have a better understanding of how treatment writing is created and building self-confidence."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"Act three, known as the resolution is when the film comes together, and the message comes through well.

His first photo book called Metropolight captured and analysed how modern architecture can make us feel. His images are driven by a search for light and a curiosity about the effects of colours and shapes on the human mind. Following the success of his book and an exhibition commissioned by the city of Prague, David has focused on teaching photography workshops at home and around the world. Recently, he also started exploring the relationship between photography and music in order to help him teach photography more effectively.  Since the beginning of the pandemic, he runs workshops online and focuses on helping his students become more attuned to the world around them. His work has been published in numerous media, including The Guardian or the Spanish El País."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"In this workshop, you'll look at how to process your photographs.

Yet, few philosophers are as misunderstood. His eloquent style, his seemingly accessible prose, as well as his controversial ideas are often appropriated and cited by many Nietzsche enthusiasts who do not possess proper training in philosophy. By doing so, they often err, misinterpreting his ideas, disregarding the depth of his concepts, unable to grasp the seriousness of his thought. In this session, Rabih will be taking a look at one of Nietzsche's most fascinating - and most misunderstood - ideas: the eternal recurrence of the same.

Through her practice, which is primarily rooted in photography and writing, she explores the creative process through the lens of wonder, intuition and joy. She is particularly interested in the manifestation of creative living in the everyday - in all our presence, not just our jobs. Ellie has been mentored by photographers Nick Knight (London, 2010/11) and Ryan McGinley (New York, 2012/13), and her work draws references from the vast sea of poetry, practices of mindfulness and well-being, the history of aesthetics and the mystical alchemies of art-making.Since 2018, she's an Associate Lecturer at the University of the Arts London, where she is teaching image-making as well as delivering and expanding her own workshops of insightful contemplation on the creative process. In early 2020, she also joined Ravensbourne University London, and launched a new chapter of her business dedicated to her original approach, 'Integrated Creativity', which she explores through private 1:1 sessions, online deliveries and a brand new podcast (2021). She lives in Forest Gate, London with her husband Liam and their one-year old son, August."},{"heading":"About The Series","content":"Integrated Creativity is Ellie Tsatsou-Palmer's holistic approach and teaching methodology through which she is employing self-reflective tools, diverse research and open dialogues in order to unpack why and how we do the creative work we do and why it matters. In these 4 workshops, she will be discussing the creative practice and the creative process by introducing the foundational pillars of her approach, as well as providing tangible concepts and examples of how it can be cultivated in one's own work. Integrated Creativity is not really about technique or equipment or shortcuts. And it’s not just about art and artists. It’s about understanding all the forces that come into play when any one of us sets out to create something that hasn’t been here before. It's a heartfelt body of work through which Ellie invites the audience to explore the physical, cognitive, emotional and spiritual dimensions of their creative worlds — placing wonder and curiosity at the forefront of the exploration."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"In this session, Ellie will be introducing the foundational ideas that form her teaching methodology, 'Integrated Creativity'.

Reading it differently you could have a million different perspectives, views and opinions about how it makes you feel. Since then he has used poetry as a way to express himself, as a medicine to a clogged up mind filled with thoughts and frustrations.\n\nTwo years ago, was the first time he performed in front of an audience. As much as it was a nerve-racking experience, his stage presence captivates audiences, leaving them entranced in his words. Since then, Ali has been invited to multiple events to perform his poetry, that often centres around self-expression, political insights and identity."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"In this workshop, Ali will define and discuss some writing techniques you can use when writing a piece of poetry.

Andreas was the Artist Educator at the museum Dia:Beacon for the Dia Teens program from 2019 – 2021 and is also the co-founder of shrimpzine, a Progressive Web App developed to help young digital natives to make zines for free on their smartphones."},{"heading":"About The Series","content":"This two-part series on the photographic portrait is intended as an approachable meditation on the foundational values in creating portraits that touch, move, and illuminate the participants during the image-making process – the sitter, the photographer – as well as the audience who come into contact with the image. With an emphasis on the personal and visceral experience of making portraits, Andreas will take steps in discussing his own photographic journey and why the portrait is such a significant aspect of his career.\nTo make a portrait is in its essence to create a sense of trust; to form a reciprocated relationship in the process; to be sensitive of the implications of making work about others that values empathy rather than extraction. Andreas believes deeply in the power of curiosity, repetition, and duration, in building interpersonal connections over time, returning to them, pursuing a relationship that involves patience, familiarity, engagement, and response. And in by doing so, accumulating images that collaboratively tell a story about somebody and their life in a deep and meaningful way.\nAndreas’ personal areas of interest – photography, zine-making, being an educator – have always centered themselves around the idea of care and community. In his work as a portrait photographer, he is invested in communication, dialogue and respect being embedded in the way he approaches his image-making. Being particularly aware of the ongoing tensions of privilege, power, representation, and visibility that are entangled within the histories of photography as a medium and its presence across art history, with this in mind, his practice sites collaboration first and foremost, and care is a constant through line, making sure that those he is photographing feel empowered, seen, held and heard."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"To make a portrait is in its essence to create a sense of trust; to form a reciprocated relationship in the process; to be sensitive to the implications of making work about others that values empathy rather than extraction.

Through her practice, which is primarily rooted in photography and writing, she explores the creative process through the lens of wonder, intuition and joy. She is particularly interested in the manifestation of creative living in the everyday - in all our presence, not just our jobs. Ellie has been mentored by photographers Nick Knight (London, 2010/11) and Ryan McGinley (New York, 2012/13), and her work draws references from the vast sea of poetry, practices of mindfulness and well-being, the history of aesthetics and the mystical alchemies of art-making.Since 2018, she's an Associate Lecturer at the University of the Arts London, where she is teaching image-making as well as delivering and expanding her own workshops of insightful contemplation on the creative process. In early 2020, she also joined Ravensbourne University London, and launched a new chapter of her business dedicated to her original approach, 'Integrated Creativity', which she explores through private 1:1 sessions, online deliveries and a brand new podcast (2021). She lives in Forest Gate, London with her husband Liam and their one-year old son, August."},{"heading":"About The Series","content":"Integrated Creativity is Ellie Tsatsou-Palmer's holistic approach and teaching methodology through which she is employing self-reflective tools, diverse research and open dialogues in order to unpack why and how we do the creative work we do and why it matters.

Integrated Creativity is not really about technique or equipment or shortcuts. And it’s not just about art and artists. It’s about understanding all the forces that come into play when any one of us sets out to create something that hasn’t been here before.

Check the paintbrush end doesn’t leave a residue on scrap paper first.\n- neoprene craft foam or felt - something soft to lay the paper on when you burnish it\n- reverse action tweezers - not essential by highly recommended!\n\nThe two downloadable templates (please refer to the Daisie Workshop Chat) - can be printed directly onto good quality paper (cut just inside the printed lines.

Through her practice, which is primarily rooted in photography and writing, she explores the creative process through the lens of wonder, intuition and joy. She is particularly interested in the manifestation of creative living in the everyday - in all our presence, not just our jobs. Ellie has been mentored by photographers Nick Knight (London, 2010/11) and Ryan McGinley (New York, 2012/13), and her work draws references from the vast sea of poetry, practices of mindfulness and well-being, the history of aesthetics and the mystical alchemies of art-making.Since 2018, she's an Associate Lecturer at the University of the Arts London, where she is teaching image-making as well as delivering and expanding her own workshops of insightful contemplation on the creative process. In early 2020, she also joined Ravensbourne University London, and launched a new chapter of her business dedicated to her original approach, 'Integrated Creativity', which she explores through private 1:1 sessions, online deliveries and a brand new podcast (2021). She lives in Forest Gate, London with her husband Liam and their one-year old son, August."},{"heading":"About The Series","content":"Integrated Creativity is Ellie Tsatsou-Palmer's holistic approach and teaching methodology through which she is employing self-reflective tools, diverse research and open dialogues in order to unpack why and how we do the creative work we do and why it matters. In these 4 workshops, she will be discussing the creative practice and the creative process by introducing the foundational pillars of her approach, as well as providing tangible concepts and examples of how it can be cultivated in one's own work. Integrated Creativity is not really about technique or equipment or shortcuts. And it’s not just about art and artists. It’s about understanding all the forces that come into play when any one of us sets out to create something that hasn’t been here before. It's a heartfelt body of work through which Ellie invites the audience to explore the physical, cognitive, emotional and spiritual dimensions of their creative worlds — placing wonder and curiosity at the forefront of the exploration."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"In this session, Ellie will present selected works from various practitioners from the field of visual arts, as well as some bibliographical resources, that can serve as important signifiers of how Integrated Creativity looks like in practice."},{"heading":"Daisie Workshop Chat","content":"You’ll be invited to join your classmates on Daisie before the Workshop begins.

He fell in love with poetry around the age of 10, whilst he was studying in secondary school.\n\nHe became addicted to writing poetry when he realised the way one poem could have a million different meanings through interpretation. Reading it differently you could have a million different perspectives, views and opinions about how it makes you feel. Since then he has used poetry as a way to express himself, as a medicine to a clogged up mind filled with thoughts and frustrations.\n\nTwo years ago, was the first time he performed in front of an audience. As much as it was a nerve-racking experience, his stage presence captivates audiences, leaving them entranced in his words. Since then, Ali has been invited to multiple events to perform his poetry, that often centres around self-expression, political insights and identity."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"A little bit of a show and tell with Ali!

Her work is focused on the tension between a form and the space it takes and where it’s contained by. Daily objects or common landscapes are, for the artist, symbols of connection between interiority and materiality. The outside world is faced and represented through suspended atmospheres, bringing the viewer into a spaceless and timeless experience. Working in both staged and spontaneous photography, combining meticulously location, colors and composition, with a particular attention on subtraction and reduction to the essential.\n\nIn 2014, Benedetta was mentioned by the magazine Vanity Fair in the Emerging Photographers section. In 2015 Benedetta was one of the finalists of the ‘Next Photographer Award’ by D&AD in partnership with Getty Images. In 2016 one photo of her project “Lay Off” was the winner of the People category in the 16th Smithsonian Magazine photo contest. In 2015 she began the series ‘East’ ended in 2018. In 2017 she was one of the 100 creative chosen to represent the Lazio region in the annual initiative “Lazio Creativo 2017”. In 2018 she self-published her first book “East”, from the homonymous series. In 2020 her project about quarantine in Rome is one of the winners of “Refocus” by MiBact in collaboration with the Museum of Contemporary Photography and Triennale Milano. Her works have been used to illustrate articles in Vice, Bloomberg Businessweek, Forbes, Label Magazine, Document Journal and others. She has worked commercially for clients like Airbnb, Fendi, Nike, Action Aid International. Her projects are exposed in various international exhibitions."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"Photo editing is what allows us to create a visual story, choosing images based on the language related to our narration.

He attended London Guildhall University, graduating with a degree in Fine Art in 2003 and moved to New York shortly after. His photographic portrait work has been published by New York Magazine, The New Yorker, The New York Times Magazine, T: The New York Times Style Magazine, Rolling Stone, W Magazine, WSJ Magazine, and others. Since 2008 he has utilized the vessel of the zine and book to create many of his own projects, as well as editing and publishing zines and books for other artists as well. Andreas was the Artist Educator at the museum Dia:Beacon for the Dia Teens program from 2019 – 2021 and is also the co-founder of shrimpzine, a Progressive Web App developed to help young digital natives to make zines for free on their smartphones."},{"heading":"About The Series","content":"This two-part series on the photographic portrait is intended as an approachable meditation on the foundational values in creating portraits that touch, move, and illuminate the participants during the image-making process – the sitter, the photographer – as well as the audience who come into contact with the image. With an emphasis on the personal and visceral experience of making portraits, Andreas will take steps in discussing his own photographic journey and why the portrait is such a significant aspect of his career.\nTo make a portrait is in its essence to create a sense of trust; to form a reciprocated relationship in the process; to be sensitive of the implications of making work about others that values empathy rather than extraction. Andreas believes deeply in the power of curiosity, repetition, and duration, in building interpersonal connections over time, returning to them, pursuing a relationship that involves patience, familiarity, engagement, and response. And in by doing so, accumulating images that collaboratively tell a story about somebody and their life in a deep and meaningful way.\nAndreas’ personal areas of interest – photography, zine-making, being an educator – have always centered themselves around the idea of care and community. In his work as a portrait photographer, he is invested in communication, dialogue and respect being embedded in the way he approaches his image-making. Being particularly aware of the ongoing tensions of privilege, power, representation, and visibility that are entangled within the histories of photography as a medium and its presence across art history, with this in mind, his practice sites collaboration first and foremost, and care is a constant through line, making sure that those he is photographing feel empowered, seen, held and heard."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"Pulling from his personal journey into photography, Andreas will share how you can apply your own thoughts and ideas to create a career in photography."},{"heading":"Daisie Workshop Chat","content":"You’ll be invited to join your classmates on Daisie before the Workshop begins.

Through her practice, which is primarily rooted in photography and writing, she explores the creative process through the lens of wonder, intuition and joy. She is particularly interested in the manifestation of creative living in the everyday - in all our presence, not just our jobs. Ellie has been mentored by photographers Nick Knight (London, 2010/11) and Ryan McGinley (New York, 2012/13), and her work draws references from the vast sea of poetry, practices of mindfulness and well-being, the history of aesthetics and the mystical alchemies of art-making.Since 2018, she's an Associate Lecturer at the University of the Arts London, where she is teaching image-making as well as delivering and expanding her own workshops of insightful contemplation on the creative process. In early 2020, she also joined Ravensbourne University London, and launched a new chapter of her business dedicated to her original approach, 'Integrated Creativity', which she explores through private 1:1 sessions, online deliveries and a brand new podcast (2021). She lives in Forest Gate, London with her husband Liam and their one-year old son, August."},{"heading":"About The Series","content":"Integrated Creativity is Ellie Tsatsou-Palmer's holistic approach and teaching methodology through which she is employing self-reflective tools, diverse research and open dialogues in order to unpack why and how we do the creative work we do and why it matters. In these 4 workshops, she will be discussing the creative practice and the creative process by introducing the foundational pillars of her approach, as well as providing tangible concepts and examples of how it can be cultivated in one's own work. Integrated Creativity is not really about technique or equipment or shortcuts. And it’s not just about art and artists. It’s about understanding all the forces that come into play when any one of us sets out to create something that hasn’t been here before.

Since then he has used poetry as a way to express himself, as a medicine to a clogged up mind filled with thoughts and frustrations.\n\nTwo years ago, was the first time he performed in front of an audience.

Her work is focused on the tension between a form and the space it takes and where it’s contained by. Daily objects or common landscapes are, for the artist, symbols of connection between interiority and materiality. The outside world is faced and represented through suspended atmospheres, bringing the viewer into a spaceless and timeless experience. Working in both staged and spontaneous photography, combining meticulously location, colors and composition, with a particular attention on subtraction and reduction to the essential.\n\nIn 2014, Benedetta was mentioned by the magazine Vanity Fair in the Emerging Photographers section. In 2015 Benedetta was one of the finalists of the ‘Next Photographer Award’ by D&AD in partnership with Getty Images. In 2016 one photo of her project “Lay Off” was the winner of the People category in the 16th Smithsonian Magazine photo contest. In 2015 she began the series ‘East’ ended in 2018. In 2017 she was one of the 100 creative chosen to represent the Lazio region in the annual initiative “Lazio Creativo 2017”. In 2018 she self-published her first book “East”, from the homonymous series. In 2020 her project about quarantine in Rome is one of the winners of “Refocus” by MiBact in collaboration with the Museum of Contemporary Photography and Triennale Milano. Her works have been used to illustrate articles in Vice, Bloomberg Businessweek, Forbes, Label Magazine, Document Journal and others.

Since the time she was a child, Juliet has been fascinated by black and white photography, colorless television shows, and film noir movies. Being exposed to the lighting effects and sharp contrasts shown in these photographs and films greatly inspired the type of work that she does today. Juliet’s work is centered around giving a voice to nature and animals, with the goal of showcasing their importance in this world. Through an illustrative take on fine art, she attempts to express a story in each drawing."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"Juliet will explain how to compose an illustration using shape theories.

Gaining an interest in image-making in their teenage years, they have since used photography as space to both experiment with, and document identity as it comes to be expressed through gender.\n\nLaurence's practise celebrates trans existence and studies identity as a space in constant flux via high-saturated, cinematic, vulnerable images. Through a process of mutual [and self] care, their photographs humanize identities that have been historically marginalized and act as a love letter to their community."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"This workshop covers different steps you can take to turn your photos into a book.

Working remotely at first with independent production companies through word-of-mouth, he eventually took the plunge and approached some creative studios, which led him to an internship-come-lead-motion-designer (over the space of almost 3 years) at the Electric Theatre Collective, ETC VFX.\n\nNow leading his own studio, Greedy Goons, George divides his time in between creating commercial motion design and directorial projects within the music industry. Selected clients include: Adidas, Apple Music, Pepsi, Puma, EA, Ray-Ban, Sky, Sony Music & UMG.\n\nAside from creating and directing, George also works as a mentor, where he not only supports people with their technical skills, but also tries to demystify the visual creative industries to make them more accessible and ultimately, more fun."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"Using the design outcome from his previous session, George will bring it to life with a motion graphics flare within the hour session.

Reading it differently you could have a million different perspectives, views and opinions about how it makes you feel. Since then he has used poetry as a way to express himself, as a medicine to a clogged up mind filled with thoughts and frustrations.\n\nTwo years ago, was the first time he performed in front of an audience.

Working remotely at first with independent production companies through word-of-mouth, he eventually took the plunge and approached some creative studios, which led him to an internship-come-lead-motion-designer (over the space of almost 3 years) at the Electric Theatre Collective, ETC VFX.\n\nNow leading his own studio, Greedy Goons, George divides his time in between creating commercial motion design and directorial projects within the music industry. Selected clients include: Adidas, Apple Music, Pepsi, Puma, EA, Ray-Ban, Sky, Sony Music & UMG.\n\nAside from creating and directing, George also works as a mentor, where he not only supports people with their technical skills, but also tries to demystify the visual creative industries to make them more accessible and ultimately, more fun."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"Want to make a music video?

Sara","content":"Sara Lorusso was born in 1995 in the Emilia Romagna countryside, a region in the north of Italy.

Always interested in the role of womxn in today’s society, she likes to tell true stories of people who are close to her or even of people she has just met. Since the first approach with photography, she has tried to spread a message of inclusion, human’s body has always been objectified and aestheticized. \"We must represent the reality in which we live, where perfection does not exist: I want gender equality\". Through her photos, she would like everyone to express the right to be themselves. Her work has been published and exhibited internationally."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"Often in art schools they don't teach us how to promote our work. In this workshop, Sara will share her personal experience of how to promote your work through collaborations, Instagram and publications. She'll also demonstrate how to pitch it to potential clients and  collaborate with other creatives in order to create a collective project, such as her publishing project: Mulieris Magazine. \n\nBeing a photographer and a magazine editor, Sara had the opportunity to be on both sides: the artist who seeks collaborations and the editor who selects the work of other artists.

He now has a 2:1 and a Leica M6.\n\nLouis enjoys documenting key issues that he’s truly passionate about. He’s spent the last few years creating series’ that are dedicated to promoting men's mental health and normalising men speaking about their mental health with their friends and family. His ongoing 'Men-Tal Health' series included interviews and familiar faces from Actor Joe Gilgun to Danny Lomas. He's currently shooting a series documenting love and relationships across the UK.\n\nThe 25-year-old has been shooting fashion advertorials and editorials for the last two years, shooting on 35mm and medium format film. Louis finds it thoroughly enjoyable to explain how film works and the process behind film photography with clients."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"Jumping into a career as a freelancer has its perks, but it can be overwhelming when most responsibilities are on you.  In this workshop, Louis will share the ins and outs of working as a freelancer: from what to expect, managing finances, creating routines, finding an agent, networking and much more. \nKey points:\n- What is to be a freelancer?\n- What to expect\n- Should I become a freelancer?\n- Choosing the right agency\n- Emailing/contacting clients\n- Work Consistency\n- Calculated risks (e.g. being frugal with finances, should I leave my current employment?)\n- Having a routine outside of work (don't let your previous 9-5 become a freelancer 24/7)\n- Meeting people in the real world (be social!)\n- Tips and Tricks"},{"heading":"Daisie Workshop Chat","content":"You’ll be invited to join your classmates

In a moment where our relationship to nature is perhaps more tenuous and distant than ever before, it is important to question how we see ourselves in nature and how we see nature without us in it. Both types of images will be included in Caleb's presentation as he explores a wide range of approaches to this topic.

He’s spent the last few years creating series’ that are dedicated to promoting men's mental health and normalising men speaking about their mental health with their friends and family.

Born in Canada, David began showing a talented interest in the visual arts from early childhood. During his high school years he was introduced to paintings by Rembrandt and Salvador Dali and was enamoured with the idea of creating his own paintings that would be just as beautiful and meaningful for his career. He was first exhibited at the Art Gallery of Hamilton at the age of 19 (A gallery that includes a multi-million dollar collection of 16th - 21st Century Masters).\n\nSeeking a post-secondary education that could help him achieve his dream, he was fortunate to find the Academy of Realist Art in Toronto.  The school’s curriculum is based on the 19th Century French Academic system made famous by William Bouguereau. The internationally acclaimed artist John Michael Angel started the school during the 1990’s Resurrection of Realism and the academy continues to be the only school in Canada that has kept the excellent standards established during the period of high Realism in 20th Century Europe. David graduated with honors from their 4-year program in 2012 and has continued his journey as an independent artist since."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"This workshop is a detailed look at an artist's journey.

Working remotely at first with independent production companies through word-of-mouth, he eventually took the plunge and approached some creative studios, which led him to an internship-come-lead-motion-designer (over the space of almost 3 years) at the Electric Theatre Collective, ETC VFX.\n\nNow leading his own studio, Greedy Goons, George divides his time in between creating commercial motion design and directorial projects within the music industry. Selected clients include: Adidas, Apple Music, Pepsi, Puma, EA, Ray-Ban, Sky, Sony Music & UMG.\n\nAside from creating and directing, George also works as a mentor, where he not only supports people with their technical skills, but also tries to demystify the visual creative industries to make them more accessible and ultimately, more fun."},{"heading":"The session","content":"In this session with George, you’ll explore his 3D motion design process in commercials.

Reading it differently you could have a million different perspectives, views and opinions about how it makes you feel. Since then he has used poetry as a way to express himself, as a medicine to a clogged up mind filled with thoughts and frustrations.\n\nTwo years ago, was the first time he performed in front of an audience.

His photographic work is suffused with the sun, ocean and dust-filled air of his environment, which he contrasts with the ephemeral and idiosyncratic nature of his subjects. The moments he captures are fleeting, candid, and tell a story of love and ennui, beauty and banality. This compelling visual style has made Todd a sought-after photographer in the fashion world, his images appearing in many international publications, including i-D, Purple, Self Service, POP, 032C, T Magazine, Vogue, The NY Times Style Magazine, The Fader, Art Review, and The Journal, among others. He has also published a photography book, I’m Yours To Keep (AndPress, 2012).\n\nThe strong storytelling instinct behind the photographic images inexorably led Todd back to film, where he plays with time and reality. Drawn in by the rich images and the spontaneous authentic-feeling performances, our perceptions are then turned on their heads by the introduction of something unexpected or even magical. In the trio of short films made in collaboration with the clothing label Rodarte, Todd blends high fashion with magical reality to critical acclaim. This Must Be the Only Fantasy (starring Elijah Wood) was voted the top fashion film of 2013 by Business of Fashion and received a People’s Choice Webby Award for Online Film & Video.

Her work is typically created using a stippling technique in pen & ink and graphite, with occasional splashes of color. Juliet’s pieces are inspired by the ocean, nature, and all of the creatures within our world. Since the time she was a child, Juliet has been fascinated by black and white photography, colorless television shows, and film noir movies. Being exposed to the lighting effects and sharp contrasts shown in these photographs and films greatly inspired the type of work that she does today. Juliet’s work is centered around giving a voice to nature and animals, with the goal of showcasing their importance in this world. Through an illustrative take on fine art, she attempts to express a story in each drawing."},{"heading":"The Session","content":"Join this workshop with Juliet where she’ll complete a small illustration showing exactly how she stipples in real-time to shade and create a final drawing.
