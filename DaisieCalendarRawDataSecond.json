She has attended artist residences from across the globe, most recently Atelier Austmarka in Norway (2022), Arteles in Finland (2019), Cow House Studios in Ireland (2018).","In this workshop with Ana, you will learn how to get out of a creative rut by learning tips and tricks to become productive and inspired."]}},"relationships":{"mentor":{"data":{"id":"user_5ESeSFJsYAB4GEhbJPJFmw","type":"users","attributes":{"username":"anagdeleon","name":"Ana Gomez de Leon","bio":"Landscape and Fine Art Photographer \n\n","flair":"mentor","url":"anagdl.com"},"relationships":{"avatar":{"data":{"id":"attachment_uH7uRj7indwYzzoZCsyi4b","type":"attachments","attributes":{"uuid":"attachment_uH7uRj7indwYzzoZCsyi4b","path":"avatars/user_5ESeSFJsYAB4GEhbJPJFmw/media_4eGJZmw5GiLsUhGzUj7CLi.jpg","extension":"jpg","type":"image","metadata":{"width":0,"height":0,"processorMediaPath":"https://daisie-assets-production.accelerator.net/avatars/user_5ESeSFJsYAB4GEhbJPJFmw/media_4eGJZmw5GiLsUhGzUj7CLi.jpg;resize(1200,9999,fit).jpg"}}}},"location":{}}}},"categories":{"data":[{"id":"projectCategory_rSgkdHR2uzEekVYH5Kzkeo","type":"projectCategories","attributes":{"name":"Art"}}]},"tags":{"data":[]},"coverMedia":{"data":{"id":"attachment_mj3DLDiK8YDmUFqns95K7x","type":"attachments","attributes":{"uuid":"attachment_mj3DLDiK8YDmUFqns95K7x","path":"images/user_fYjEom96o7TACHadseRvML/media_tZ6SDHhUTRWvWhB9Wq9Cnh.jpg","extension":"jpg","type":"image","metadata":{"fileName":"media_i797od4TcSn6ff6jEvsJdb.jpg","processorMediaPath":"https://daisie-assets-production.accelerator.net/images/user_fYjEom96o7TACHadseRvML/media_tZ6SDHhUTRWvWhB9Wq9Cnh.jpg;resize(1200,9999,fit).jpg"}}}}}}},"attendees":{"data":[{"id":"user_iragRdkQxmtEtviUWCayV6","type":"users","attributes":{"username":"rachel","name":"Rachel W.yen","bio":"Violinist / Composer / Storyteller","url":"rachelwyen.com","flair":"super_user"},"relationships":{"avatar":{"data":{"id":"attachment_rF2Enpp7UwT9i9TaxoKMeF","type":"attachments","attributes":{"uuid":"attachment_rF2Enpp7UwT9i9TaxoKMeF","path":"avatars/user_iragRdkQxmtEtviUWCayV6/media_aSEW1D2xHtS28kvkvmqUy6.jpg","extension":"jpg","type":"image","metadata":{"width":0,"height":0,"processorMediaPath":"https://daisie-assets-production.accelerator.net/avatars/user_iragRdkQxmtEtviUWCayV6/media_aSEW1D2xHtS28kvkvmqUy6.jpg;resize(1200,9999,fit).jpg"}}}}}},{"id":"user_rF3FGKXYPYuaVGBZQ6qePk","type":"users","attributes":{"username":"dvhlsk","name":"David H","bio":"Brand & Senior Graphic Designer","url":"","flair":"founding_member"},"relationships":{"avatar":{"data":{"id":"attachment_sATNmU6meQiFoSDxeUB2P2","type":"attachments","attributes":{"uuid":"attachment_sATNmU6meQiFoSDxeUB2P2","path":"avatars/user_rF3FGKXYPYuaVGBZQ6qePk/media_jhGxWnZWBxdWU794qeEPVi.jpg","extension":"jpg","type":"image","metadata":{"width":0,"height":0,"processorMediaPath":"https://daisie-assets-production.accelerator.net/avatars/user_rF3FGKXYPYuaVGBZQ6qePk/media_jhGxWnZWBxdWU794qeEPVi.jpg;resize(1200,9999,fit).jpg"}}}}}},{"id":"user_umdmDiL45kSjDWxbsqpdmu","type":"users","attributes":{"username":"vilte","name":"Vilte","bio":"Creative: https://www.instagram.com/viltesvanyte/","url":"viltesvanyte.com","flair":"founding_member"},"relationships":{"avatar":{"data":{"id":"attachment_5veT18k6cX7Ysr53vtehGP","type":"attachments","attributes":{"uuid":"attachment_5veT18k6cX7Ysr53vtehGP","path":"avatars/user_umdmDiL45kSjDWxbsqpdmu/media_rP9HfMCBdU5rFvdeBE98CL.jpg","extension":"jpg","type":"image","metadata":{"width":0,"height":0,"processorMediaPath":"https://daisie-assets-production.accelerator.net/avatars/user_umdmDiL45kSjDWxbsqpdmu/media_rP9HfMCBdU5rFvdeBE98CL.jpg;resize(1200,9999,fit).jpg"}}}}}}]}}}}}},{"id":"workshopSession_22ULSyVo9bV9Fo9LkG8jrm","type":"calendar","attributes":{"start":"2023-01-13T20:00:00.000Z","end":"2023-01-13T21:00:00.000Z","attendeeCount":41},"relationships":{"currentUserData":{"data":{"id":"","type":"currentUserData"}},"batch":{"data":{"id":"workshopBatch_oawds8f5b76h7iGXJLm1US","type":"workshopBatches","attributes":{"updatedAt":"2022-12-16T15:06:24.576Z","createdAt":"2022-12-16T15:06:24.576Z","attendeeLimit":400,"attendeeCount":41},"relationships":{"workshop":{"data":{"id":"workshop_vNXPvQUak1PJ3k5kQPCPY6","type":"workshops","attributes":{"title":"How to Price Your Photography","formattedTitle":"","slug":"How-to-Price-Your-Photography-vNXPvQUak1PJ3k5kQPCPY6","description":"Pricing your photography can be a very overwhelming process, even for a seasoned professional!
